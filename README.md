# HTML & CSS Profile

## Assignment

Make a website page using HTML and CSS to present your profile.


## Process

I first used HTML to layout the structure of the website, filling in content either using information from my profile or placeholder text. I then used CSS to style the page, I tried to keep the page looking as 'clean' and organised as I could, and I also wanted it be mobile friendly so I opted to use Bootstrap for the laying out the content in the page.

The navigation bar at the top don't take you to new pages, but rather places on the page where that content was present.
